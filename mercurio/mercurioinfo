These are calculations of the orbit of Mercury, but with some twists. Jupiter's mass is actually big enough so that its gravity changes Mercury's trajectory. 
We explored that and played around how would its orbit change depending on Jupiter's mass, it's pretty funny, eventually Mercury is just catapulted away
